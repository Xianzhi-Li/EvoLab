# EvoLab
## Description of Evolab 
Evolab is an evolutionary psychology experimenting research lab that is interested the subjective perceptions in people. For example, it explores the effects of technology; how does darkness influence people’s perception of objects; how does physical risk-taking influence people’s perception of time, etc. 

## Description of the project
I am looking for team members to **<u>build</u>** a website with multiple pages to *display information* about research labs and **<u>design</u>** it to be professional-looking and *viewer-friendly*. Information displayed on the website should include, but not limited to the description of on-going projects, introduction of group members, and presentation of past findings. The final website will be hosted under the official UCM domain, so it will need to <u>**suffice requirements of the web development requested by UCM**</u>. The final design of the website needs to be approved by the specific professor, so you will need to attend **<u>bi-weekly meetings</u>** with the professor to understand what exactly does he desire. 

###### You don’t need to:
+  Storing user data (i.e. Log-in or dashboard)
+  Maintain it after the project has been completed. (Of course, you are welcome to maintain the website, but it is not required.) 
+  Be a part of the regular lab business, or fully understand everything the lab is doing. 

###### You will get: 
+  A good hands-on web development project on your resume
+  Great networking opportunity with professors in cognitive science field 
+  A letter of recommendation (by request)
